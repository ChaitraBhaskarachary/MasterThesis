# Notice
Even though you can not train the classifiers here, note the following:
 - We extracted resting EEG signals from the Healthy Brain Network dataset, made available by The Child Mind Institute through the 1000     Functional Connec- tomes Project / INDI. The EEG signals are publicly available, however pheno- typical data must be accessed through the Healthy Brain Network-dedicated instance of the Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS).

- Downloading FCP-INDI Neuroimaging Data from Amazon S3
- LORIS instance of Healthy Brain Network
